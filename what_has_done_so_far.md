# Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) Implementation - Progress Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a Python library for Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) based on Kanerva's work. This implementation provides a foundation for building efficient, memory-friendly models that leverage high-dimensional vector representations.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Operations

- **Vector Generation**: Random binary, bipolar, and continuous vector generation
- **Binding Operations**: XOR for binary vectors, element-wise multiplication for bipolar vectors
- **Bundling Operations**: Majority rule for binary vectors, sign function for bipolar vectors
- **Permutation**: Cyclic shift for encoding position information
- **Similarity Measures**: Hamming distance, cosine similarity, dot product similarity

### 2. Data Structures

- **Hash Table**: Key-value storage using HDC principles
  - Supports adding, retrieving, and removing key-value pairs
  - Implements similarity-based lookup
- **Sequence**: Ordered data structure with position encoding
  - Supports appending, extending, and retrieving elements
  - Implements n-gram generation

### 3. Text Processing

- **Tokenizers**: Simple word tokenizer and character n-gram tokenizer
- **Encoders**: Random encoder and n-gram based encoder for text
  - Converts tokens to hypervectors
  - Supports sequence encoding

### 4. Language Models

- **N-Gram Language Model**: Predicts next token based on n-1 previous tokens
- **Contextual Language Model**: Uses sliding window with position-dependent encoding

### 5. Testing

- Comprehensive test suite for all components
- Unit tests for core operations, data structures, and models

## Performance Characteristics

- The implementation is designed to be memory-efficient
- Operations are vectorized using NumPy for performance
- The code is structured to allow for easy extension and customization

## Current Limitations

- The current implementation is optimized for clarity rather than maximum performance
- For real-world applications with very high-dimensional vectors (10,000+), the binding and bundling approach would work better
- The language models are simple demonstrations and would need refinement for practical applications

## Next Steps

- Optimize performance for large-scale applications
- Implement more advanced HDC models (e.g., for classification, anomaly detection)
- Add support for distributed computing
- Explore hardware acceleration options
- Develop more sophisticated language models
- Add visualization tools for hypervector spaces

This implementation provides a solid foundation for exploring HDC further and applying it to various tasks. The code is modular and extensible, making it easy to add new features or adapt it to different applications.
