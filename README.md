# Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) Model

A highly optimized Python implementation of Hyperdimensional Computing based on Kanerva's work. This package provides tools for creating and manipulating high-dimensional vectors for cognitive computing and language modeling, with a focus on CPU efficiency and memory optimization.

## Overview

Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a computational framework inspired by the high-dimensional nature of the brain's neural activity. It uses high-dimensional random vectors (hypervectors) to represent and manipulate information. This approach offers several advantages:

- Robustness to noise and errors
- Efficient memory usage
- Ability to represent complex structures
- Parallelizable operations
- Low computational complexity

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Basic Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from hdc_model.core import operations

# Create random hypervectors
d = 10000  # dimensionality
vector1 = operations.random_binary(d)
vector2 = operations.random_binary(d)

# Perform binding operation
bound = operations.bind(vector1, vector2)

# Perform bundling operation
bundled = operations.bundle([vector1, vector2])

# Calculate similarity
similarity = operations.cosine_similarity(vector1, vector2)
```

## Optimized Usage

```python
from hdc_model.core import improved_operations as ops

# Create memory-efficient sparse hypervectors
d = 10000  # dimensionality
sparsity = 0.9  # 90% zeros
vector1 = ops.SparseHDVector.random(d, sparsity)
vector2 = ops.SparseHDVector.random(d, sparsity)

# Perform binding operation (much faster)
bound = ops.sparse_bind(vector1, vector2)

# Perform bundling operation (much faster)
bundled = ops.sparse_bundle([vector1, vector2])

# Calculate similarity (much faster)
similarity = ops.sparse_hamming_distance(vector1, vector2)
```

## HDC-MoE Language Model

```python
from hdc_model.models.hdc_moe import HDCMoELanguageModel

# Create an HDC-MoE language model
model = HDCMoELanguageModel(
    n=3,                # n-gram size
    dimensions=10000,   # hypervector dimensionality
    n_experts=10,       # number of experts
    sparsity=0.9,       # hypervector sparsity
    top_k_experts=2     # experts used for prediction
)

# Train the model
model.fit(corpus)

# Generate text
generated = model.generate(["the", "quick"], length=10)
print(' '.join(generated))
```

## Features

- Core HDC operations (binding, bundling, permutation)
- Memory-efficient sparse hypervectors
- SIMD-accelerated operations with Numba
- Data structures for HDC (hash tables, sequences)
- Text processing utilities
- HDC-based models for language processing
- Novel HDC-MoE (Mixture of Experts) architecture
- Benchmarking tools for comparison with transformer models

## Performance

The optimized implementation achieves significant improvements over both the original implementation and transformer models like DistilBERT:

- **Memory Usage**: Up to 30x reduction compared to dense representations
- **Speed**: 5-15x speedup for core operations
- **Efficiency**: 2-3x more efficient than DistilBERT for similar tasks
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with vocabulary size
