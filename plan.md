Development Plan: Novel CPU-Efficient Language Model
Phase 1: Research and Foundation (4-6 weeks)
Key Research Areas
Read foundational papers on:
Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC): Kanerva's "Hyperdimensional Computing" paper
Sparse Distributed Memory: Kanerva's work on SDM
Neuro-symbolic systems: papers by Henry Kautz, Gary Marcus
Vector Symbolic Architectures: Tony Plate's "Holographic Reduced Representation"
Environment Setup
Set up Python development environment with NumPy, SciPy
Create GitHub repository for code and documentation
Prepare small text datasets for initial testing (e.g., subset of WikiText)
Concept Selection
Choose 1-2 primary approaches to focus on first (recommend HDC or neuro-symbolic)
Define mathematical framework for your chosen approach
Design initial data structures and algorithms
Phase 2: Prototype Development (6-8 weeks)
For Hyperdimensional Computing Approach
