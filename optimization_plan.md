# HDC Optimization Plan: Achieving 2× Efficiency Over DistilBERT

## 1. Optimize for Efficiency

### Vector Operations
- **Bit-packing for Binary Vectors**: Store 32 dimensions in a single 32-bit integer to reduce memory usage
- **SIMD Acceleration**: Leverage NumPy's vectorized operations and libraries like Numba to utilize CPU SIMD instructions
- **Optimized Binding & Bundling**: Reimplement core operations with low-level optimizations

### Sparse Hypervectors
- **Transition to Sparse Representations**: Maintain effectiveness with fewer non-zero elements
- **Compressed Storage Formats**: Use formats like CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) for efficient storage
- **Sparse-Optimized Operations**: Implement specialized versions of binding and bundling for sparse vectors

## 2. Design an Innovative HDC-Based Model

### HDC Attention Mechanism
- **Replace Self-Attention**: Develop an HDC-based alternative to transformer attention
- **Binding for Contextual Relationships**: Use binding operations to encode relationships between tokens
- **Permutation for Position**: Apply permutation operations for positional encoding
- **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminate the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms

### Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture
- **HDC-Based Gating**: Use Hamming distance or cosine similarity as gating mechanisms
- **Selective Computation**: Activate only relevant "expert" components based on input
- **Balanced Efficiency**: Maintain accuracy while minimizing computation

## 3. Reduce Memory Usage

### Hypervector Compression
- **Quantization**: Reduce precision of continuous vectors (e.g., from float32 to int8)
- **HDC-Specific Dimensionality Reduction**: Explore techniques that preserve HDC properties
- **Progressive Precision**: Use higher precision only where needed

### Efficient Storage
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor**: Optimize hash tables with ANN techniques
- **Memory-Mapped Storage**: Enable processing of datasets larger than RAM
- **Incremental Learning**: Update models without storing all training data

## 4. Boost Speed

### Parallelization
- **Multi-Core Processing**: Distribute HDC operations across CPU cores
- **GPU Support**: Explore GPU acceleration for batch operations
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Implement non-blocking operations where applicable

### Caching
- **Frequent Pattern Caching**: Store common n-grams or token encodings
- **Lazy Computation**: Calculate values only when needed
- **Precomputation**: Generate and store frequently used hypervectors

## 5. Benchmark and Validate

### Comparison with DistilBERT
- **Standard Datasets**: Test on WikiText, GLUE, or similar benchmarks
- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - Speed: Inference time, tokens/second
  - Memory: Peak RAM usage, model size
  - Accuracy: Perplexity, F1 score, accuracy
- **Target**: 2× improvement in speed/memory with ≤1% performance degradation

### Profiling and Tracking
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Use cProfile to find slow operations
- **Track Experiments**: Log results with MLflow or similar tools
- **Ablation Studies**: Measure impact of individual optimizations
